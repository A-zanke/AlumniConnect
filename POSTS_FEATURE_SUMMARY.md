## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Text Formatting Strategy:
```javascript
// Regex patterns for detection
const patterns = {
  bold: /\*\*(.+?)\*\*/g,
  italic: /\*(.+?)\*/g,
  link: /(https?:\/\/[^\s]+)/g,
  mention: /@([a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+)/g,
  hashtag: /#([a-zA-Z0-9_]+)/g
};

// Parsing algorithm:
1. Find all matches for each pattern
2. Sort by position to maintain order
3. Filter overlapping matches (keep first)
4. Build React elements with styling
5. Preserve line breaks and whitespace
```

### State Management:
- **Local state** for UI interactions (comments, reactions)
- **useEffect hooks** for synchronization with server data
- **Optimistic updates** for better perceived performance
- **Automatic refresh** after mutations

### API Integration:
- **Axios** for HTTP requests
- **FormData** for file uploads
- **Multipart/form-data** for media
- **JWT authentication** via middleware
- **Error handling** with toast notifications

---

## 📋 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Recommended:
1. **Install react-hot-toast** (if not already):
   ```bash
   npm install react-hot-toast
   ```

2. **Restart backend server** to ensure all routes are loaded

3. **Test all features**:
   - Create posts with formatting
   - Upload multiple images
   - Add reactions
   - Comment and reply
   - Share posts
   - Delete posts

### Future Enhancements:
1. **Hashtag Search**: Implement search functionality for hashtags
2. **Mention Notifications**: Notify users when mentioned
3. **Image Compression**: Compress images before upload
4. **Lazy Loading**: Load images on scroll for performance
5. **Alt Text**: Add alt text input for accessibility
6. **Edit Posts**: Allow users to edit their posts
7. **Post Analytics**: Track views, engagement
8. **Saved Posts**: Bookmark posts for later
9. **Post Filters**: Filter by hashtags, mentions, date
10. **Infinite Scroll**: Load more posts on scroll

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Posts Not Showing:
1. Check if backend server is running
2. Verify API endpoint: `/api/posts` returns data
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Ensure user is authenticated
5. Check post visibility settings

### Images Not Uploading:
1. Verify `uploads/` directory exists in backend
2. Check file size (max 50MB)
3. Ensure file types are allowed (jpeg, jpg, png, gif, mp4, mov, avi)
4. Check multer configuration in `postsRoutes.js`

### Formatting Not Working:
1. Ensure `textFormatter.js` is imported
2. Check if `formatPostContent()` is called
3. Verify regex patterns are correct
4. Check browser console for errors

### Reactions Not Working:
1. Verify `/api/posts/:id/react` endpoint exists
2. Check if user is authenticated
3. Ensure reaction type is valid
4. Check backend response format

## 📊 Performance Considerations

### Current Implementation:
- ✅ Efficient regex parsing for typical post lengths
- ✅ Optimistic UI updates for better UX
- ✅ Lazy state updates with useEffect
- ✅ Memoized calculations where needed

### For Large Scale:
- Consider **memoization** for very long posts (>10,000 chars)
- Implement **virtual scrolling** for many posts
- Add **image lazy loading** for performance
- Use **CDN** for media storage
- Implement **caching** strategies

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

### Current Security:
- ✅ JWT authentication on all routes
- ✅ User ownership verification for delete
- ✅ File type validation for uploads
- ✅ File size limits (50MB)
- ✅ Text-only formatting (no HTML injection)

### Important:
- The formatter **does NOT sanitize HTML** - it only formats plain text
- If you ever accept HTML input, **add sanitization** (e.g., DOMPurify)
- Backend already extracts and stores mentions/hashtags safely
