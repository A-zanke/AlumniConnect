---

## 2. Department & Year Linking

### Dynamic Department Fetching
- ✅ Departments are fetched from the Register Page
- ✅ Only departments selected by students during registration appear in event creation
- ✅ Fallback to default departments: `['CSE', 'AI-DS', 'E&TC', 'Mechanical', 'Civil', 'Other']`

### Event Targeting
- ✅ **Admin/Teacher**: Select multiple departments and years
- ✅ **Alumni**: Select departments only (all years notified)
- ✅ Events visible only to targeted department/year combinations
- ✅ Strict filtering ensures students only see relevant events

---

## 3. Event Creation & Management

### Event Creation Rules
```javascript
// Admin/Teacher can create with:
- Multiple departments
- Multiple years per department
- Full access to attendance tracking

// Alumni can create with:
- Department-level selection only
- Requires admin approval
- Cannot access student data
```

### Event Model Fields
```javascript
{
  // Registration settings
  requiresRegistration: Boolean (default: true),
  registrationDeadline: Date,
  maxAttendees: Number,
  
  // Tracking
  registrationCount: Number (default: 0),
  attendanceCount: Number (default: 0),
  
  // Targeting
  target_roles: ['student', 'teacher', 'alumni'],
  target_student_combinations: [{ department, year }],
  target_teacher_departments: [String],
  target_alumni_combinations: [{ department, graduation_year }]
}
```

---

## 4. Student Registration System

### Registration Flow
1. Student clicks "Register for Event"
2. Modal opens with pre-filled user data
3. Student fills:
   - Name (pre-filled from profile)
   - Roll Number
   - Year (pre-filled from profile)
   - Department (pre-filled from profile)
   - Division (dropdown: A-F)
4. Registration saved to `EventRegistration` collection
5. Event `registrationCount` incremented
6. User added to event `rsvps` array

### Registration Model
```javascript
{
  event: ObjectId (ref: 'Event'),
  user: ObjectId (ref: 'User'),
  name: String,
  rollNo: String,
  year: Number,
  department: String,
  division: String,
  attended: Boolean (default: false),
  attendedAt: Date,
  registeredAt: Date (default: Date.now),
  reminderSent: Boolean,
  reminderSentAt: Date
}
```

### Validation
- ✅ Prevents duplicate registrations (compound index on event + user)
- ✅ Checks registration deadline
- ✅ Validates max attendees capacity
- ✅ All fields required

---

## 5. Attendance Tracking

### Features
- ✅ Real-time attendance marking
- ✅ Search by name, roll number, or department
- ✅ Filter by attendance status (All, Attended, Not Attended)
- ✅ Visual statistics dashboard
- ✅ One-click mark/unmark attendance
- ✅ Automatic attendance count updates

### Access Control
```javascript
// Can manage attendance:
- Admin (all events)
- Teacher (all events)
- Event Creator (own events only)

// Cannot manage attendance:
- Alumni (even for own events)
- Students
```

### Attendance Tracker UI
- Total Registered count
- Attended count
- Not Attended count
- Searchable table with:
  - Name
  - Roll No
  - Department
  - Year
  - Division
  - Status badge
  - Mark/Unmark button

---

## 6. CSV Download Feature

### CSV Contents
```csv
Name, Roll No, Department, Year, Division, Attended, Registered At, Email
```

### Access Control
- ✅ **Admin**: Can download for any event
- ✅ **Teacher**: Can download for any event
- ✅ **Event Creator** (if Teacher/Admin): Can download for own events
- ❌ **Alumni**: Cannot download (even for own events)
- ❌ **Students**: Cannot download

### Implementation
```javascript
// Backend generates CSV
GET /api/events/:eventId/registrations/download

// Frontend triggers download
const handleDownloadCSV = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/events/${eventId}/registrations/download`);
  const blob = await response.blob();
  // Create download link
};
```

---

## 7. Notification System

### Event Creation Notifications
- ✅ Notifications sent to all targeted users
- ✅ Real-time via Socket.io
- ✅ Stored in Notification collection
- ✅ Targeted based on role, department, and year

### Notification Logic
```javascript
// For Students
if (target_roles.includes('student')) {
  // Find students matching department + year combinations
  const students = await User.find({
    role: 'student',
    $or: target_student_combinations.map(c => ({
      department: c.department,
      year: c.year
    }))
  });
}

// For Teachers
if (target_roles.includes('teacher')) {
  // Find teachers in specified departments
  const teachers = await User.find({
    role: 'teacher',
    department: { $in: target_teacher_departments }
  });
}

// For Alumni
if (target_roles.includes('alumni')) {
  // Find alumni matching department + graduation year
  const alumni = await User.find({
    role: 'alumni',
    $or: target_alumni_combinations.map(c => ({
      department: c.department,
      graduationYear: c.graduation_year
    }))
  });
}
```

### Future Enhancement (Reminder System)
```javascript
// Placeholder for scheduled reminders
// Can be implemented using node-cron or similar
const scheduleEventReminder = (event) => {
  const reminderTime = new Date(event.startAt);
  reminderTime.setHours(reminderTime.getHours() - 24); // 24 hours before
  
  // Schedule notification
  // Send to all registered users
};
```

---

## 8. Event Filtering & Visibility

### Student View
```javascript
// Students only see events where:
- target_roles includes 'student'
- AND their department + year matches target_student_combinations
```

### Teacher/Admin View
```javascript
// Teachers/Admins see:
- All active events
- Events they created (any status)
- Pending events (Admin only)
```

### Alumni View
```javascript
// Alumni see:
- Events targeting alumni with their department
- Events they created (any status)
```

2. Admin reviews in "Pending Approval" tab
3. Admin approves → status: 'active', notifications sent
4. Admin rejects → status: 'rejected'

### Student Registration Validation
- Duplicate prevention via compound unique index
- Registration deadline check
- Max attendees capacity check
- All fields required (name, rollNo, year, department, division)

### CSV Format
- UTF-8 encoding
- Comma-separated values
- Quoted strings to handle commas in data
- Headers included
- Filename: `event-registrations-{eventId}.csv`

---

## 17. Error Handling

### Backend Error Responses
```javascript
// 400 - Bad Request
