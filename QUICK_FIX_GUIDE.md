# Quick Fix Guide for Forum API Issues

## Problem Summary
Users are getting "failed" popup messages when trying to:
- Vote on polls
- React to posts
- Create posts
- Comment on posts

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue is likely one of the following:
1. **Authentication token not being sent properly**
2. **API endpoints not responding correctly**
3. **Database connection issues**
4. **CORS configuration problems**

## Immediate Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added detailed error messages in frontend
- Added console logging for debugging
- Improved user feedback

### 2. Added Debugging
- Frontend: API request/response logging
- Backend: Request parameter logging
- Token validation warnings

## Step-by-Step Testing

### Step 1: Check Authentication
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Application/Storage tab
3. Check if `token` exists in localStorage
4. If not, login again

### Step 2: Test API Calls
1. Open browser console
2. Try to vote on a poll
3. Look for console logs:
   ```
   API Request: POST /api/unified-forum/posts/123/poll/vote
   API Response: 200 { success: true, data: {...} }
   ```

### Step 3: Check Backend Logs
1. Check backend console for logs:
   ```
   Vote poll request: { params: {...}, body: {...}, user: "..." }
   ```

## Common Solutions

### If you see "No token found in localStorage":
1. Logout and login again
2. Check if login is working properly

### If you see 401 errors:
1. Check if token is valid
2. Check if user is properly authenticated

### If you see 500 errors:
1. Check if database is running
2. Check backend console for error details

### If you see CORS errors:
1. Check if frontend and backend are on correct ports
2. Check CORS configuration in server.js

## Quick Test Commands

### Test Backend
```bash
cd AlumniConnect/backend
npm start
```

### Test Frontend
```bash
cd AlumniConnect/frontend
npm start
```

### Test API Directly
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/unified-forum/posts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Poll Voting**: Click on poll option → Vote recorded → Results update immediately
2. **Reactions**: Click on reaction emoji → Reaction added → Count updates immediately
3. **Post Creation**: Fill form → Submit → Post appears in feed immediately
4. **Comments**: Type comment → Submit → Comment appears immediately

## If Issues Persist

1. Check browser console for specific error messages
2. Check backend console for error details
3. Verify database connection
4. Check network tab for failed requests
5. Try logging out and logging in again

The debugging logs will help identify the exact issue!
