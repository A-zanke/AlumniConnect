## üí° How It Works

### Text Formatting:

2. `formatPostContent()` parses the text
3. Regex patterns detect formatting
4. React elements are generated with styling
5. Content is rendered with proper formatting

### Image Uploads:
1. User selects images (max 5)
2. FormData is created with images
3. Multer processes uploads on backend
4. Images are stored in `uploads/` folder
5. URLs are returned and stored in database

### Reactions:
1. User hovers over reaction button
2. Reaction picker appears
3. User selects reaction type
4. API call updates post reactions
5. UI updates with new reaction

### Comments:
1. User types comment
2. API call creates comment
3. Comment is added to post
4. UI updates with new comment
5. Formatting is applied

## üé® UI/UX Highlights

### Design Principles:
- **Modern**: Gradient backgrounds, rounded corners
- **Interactive**: Hover effects, smooth animations
- **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Accessible**: Clear labels, good contrast
- **Professional**: LinkedIn/Instagram-inspired

### Color Scheme:
- Primary: Indigo/Blue gradient
- Reactions: Color-coded (blue, red, green, purple, yellow, orange)
- Text: Slate gray scale
- Backgrounds: White cards on gradient background

### Animations:
- Fade in on load
- Scale on hover
- Slide in for modals
- Smooth transitions

- ‚úÖ Secure file naming (timestamps + random)

### Data Validation:
- ‚úÖ Content required (text or images)

## üìä Performance

### Optimizations:

## üêõ Known Limitations

### Current Limitations:
1. **No post editing** - Users can only delete and recreate
2. **No hashtag search** - Hashtags are highlighted but not searchable yet
3. **No mention notifications** - Mentions work but don't notify users
4. **No image compression** - Large images upload as-is
5. **No infinite scroll** - Pagination exists but not implemented in UI

### Future Enhancements:
- Edit posts
- Hashtag search functionality
- Mention notifications
- Image compression before upload
- Infinite scroll for posts
- Post analytics (views, engagement)
- Saved posts feature
- Post filters (by hashtag, user, date)
