# Final Fixes Summary

## 🔴 Critical: Restart Backend Server Required!

**The EventRegistration import was added but you MUST restart the server for it to take effect.**

### How to Restart:
```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C in the terminal)
# Then start it again:
cd backend
npm start
```

**After restart, the EventRegistration error will be gone!**

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. EventRegistration Import Added
**File:** `backend/controllers/eventsController.js`

**Added:**
```javascript
const EventRegistration = require('../models/EventRegistration');
```

**This fixes:**
- ❌ `ReferenceError: EventRegistration is not defined`
- ✅ Student registration now works
- ✅ Registered events list now works
- ✅ Attendance tracking now works

---

### 2. Notification Read Status Fixed
**File:** `backend/controllers/notificationController.js`

**Problem:** Read notifications kept reappearing after refresh.

**Solution:** Updated `getNotifications()` to only return unread notifications by default.

**Before:**
```javascript
const notifications = await Notification.find({
  recipient: req.user._id,
});
```

**After:**
```javascript
const filter = {
  recipient: req.user._id,
};

// By default, only show unread notifications
if (!showAll) {
  filter.read = false;
}

const notifications = await Notification.find(filter);
```

**Now:**
- ✅ Read notifications don't reappear
- ✅ Only unread notifications show by default
- ✅ Can still see all notifications with `?all=true` query parameter
