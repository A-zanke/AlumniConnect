# Department Management Implementation

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Updated Department model to only have `name` field (removed `code`)
- [x] Created `departmentRoutes.js` with GET endpoint to list all departments
- [x] Added departmentRoutes to server.js
- [x] Updated RegisterPage.js to fetch departments dynamically from API
- [x] Updated seed_departments.js with correct department names (CSE, AI-DS, E&TC, Mechanical, Civil, Other)

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Update authController.js to use only `name` for department findOne and create (remove code field)
- [ ] Run seed script to populate departments in DB
- [ ] Test registration with new department system
- [ ] Update profile update logic if needed for department changes

## Notes
- AuthController edits failed due to exact match issues; manual update may be required
- Seeding failed due to DB connection timeout; run when DB is available
- Frontend now dynamically loads departments from API, allowing for easy addition of new departments via DB
